## Open Source Contributions

I have contributed to the "linkify" package (300K+ downloads), a Dart package that converts text into clickable links. My contribution fixed an issue where URLs containing quotation marks (e.g., example.com/over/there?name="ferret") were not fully recognized as links. This improvement ensures that links with special characters are now correctly detected.
